				<p> I love travelling and trying new things. I like when I meet people from different countries so I can know more about their culture, language, cuisine, customs.

					I am lucky because I have had the chance to be to some countries around the world but there are so many of them I have not visited yet but I definitely will!.
				</p><br>
				<p> Enjoy doing things that take me out of my comfort zone and realize that it was not that bad as I thought they were going to be.</p><br>

				<img src="../img/pic6.jpg" class="pic1-about" alt="Picture About">
				<p>I also love reading about different topics, such as personal development, entrepreneurship, financial freedom, business, etc. I enjoy spending time outdoors as well. I like working out, playing tennis and soccer.
				</p><br>
				<p> 3d modelling is also my hobbie, even though it is related to design, I love to get into the 3d programm and model any object, usually is about videogames.
				</p>

        <p>Photography is a hobby that I really enjoy and would like to take it seriously. I want to study all about photography and composition and eventually make it into a career.
          Here I am showing some of my favourite shots.
